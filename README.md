<h1>Keep track of your daily activites with TaskPad</h1>
<p>When it comes to managing your daily productivity, you need an app that not only sets up your checklist up every day,
but also keep track on your productivity.</p>
<p>I decided to make this app to solve a problem I had on my computer. I like to manage my day to day taks, and keep score
to track how well I do during the week. However, I couldn't find an app that really tracked tasks in this way. I would end
up using a notepad widget on my desktop and manually check and uncheck everytask, marking down score, ect. After learning 
about electron, I decided to turn my notepad into a real app that handles all the tedious work for me, and thus, Taskpad was born</p>
